# Ecommerce-Website
An online application that allows you to input and gain access to store records 

NB: This includes both frontend and backend of the online store

The task was to create a website/webapp that allows you to input and access store records while being password protected.
This was achieved using pythons HTTPSERVER module that allowed to create a server that handles and retrieves incoming and requested data.

The goal of the frontend design was to achive a very basic layout that would be easy and straightforward to use.

succesful running of the program gives a mutable csv file that contains inputed records.
