# Ecommerce-Website
An online application that allows you to input and gain access to store records 

NB: This includes both frontend and backend of the online store

The task was to create a website/webapp that allows you to input and access store records while being password protected.
This was achieved using pythons HTTPSERVER module that allowed to create a server that handles and retrieves incoming and requested data.
